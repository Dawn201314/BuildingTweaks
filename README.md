# Instant Build

## Description
__Instant Build__ is a mod for __Green Hell__ that allows the player to instantly build blueprints and finish the ones that are already placed.

----

## Install
### If you already have ModAPI installed:
Copy the .mod file inside directory "__[...]/modapi/mods/GH/__". Then launch __ModAPI.exe__, select "InstantBuild" in the left menu and click "Launch the game".

### If you don't have ModAPI yet:
Go to [https://modapi.survivetheforest.net/game/GH/](https://modapi.survivetheforest.net/game/GH/), check "Instant Build" from the mods list and hit "Download". Then extract the archive, launch __ModAPI.exe__, select "InstantBuild" in the left menu and click "Launch the game".

----

This mod does not require any additional mods to work properly.

----

## Usage for singleplayer or host
When in game simply press the shortcut to open settings window (by default it is __NumPad8__).

## Usage for multiplayer when you are not the host
Open settings window (by default it is __NumPad8__) then click "__Ask permission__" button.

If the host answers "__Allowed__" (without quotes) in the chat you will be granted permission to use the mod.

The host doesn't need to install any mods (it works even if the host doesn't have ModAPI).

----

## Changelogs
__v1.0.0.4__: It is now possible to enable "Instant build" feature and "Finish blueprints" shortcut at the same time.

__v1.0.0.2__: Now works in multiplayer when you are not the host (open settings window and click on "__Ask permission__" button).
